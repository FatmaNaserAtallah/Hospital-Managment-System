Machine Learning Model
The project includes an AI component for classifying brain tumors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch using PyTorch. The model classifies MRI images of brain tumors into the following categories:

No Tumor
Adenoma of the Pituitary Gland
Meningioma
Glioblastoma
Dataset
The dataset used includes MRI images of brain tumors labeled according to these four categories. This dataset facilitates training and evaluating the CNN model.

Implementation
Model Architecture
CNN Architecture: The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers, batch normalization, and fully connected layers to ensure effective feature extraction and accurate classification.
Training Process
Data Preprocessing: Images are resized and pixel values normalized to prepare the data for training.
Optimization: The loss function and optimizer are defined, and the model is trained over several epochs, with validation accuracy being monitored throughout.
